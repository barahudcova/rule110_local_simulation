# Local Universality of Rule 110

This is a compelemntary material to our paper Self-replication and Computational Universality. 
The repo contains an explicit implementation of an arbitrary admissible cyclic tag system being simulated by Rule 110. We focus on the encoder, decoder, and time-delay functions.

Use case:
1) Download all dependencies in the requirements.txt file
2) Open the rule110.py file and specify the cyclic tag you wish to see being simulated: if the tag is not admissible, the program will sooner or later crash. The outcome will be stored in a folder that will be created in the directory of your project, decoding the contents of Rule 110's simulation.
